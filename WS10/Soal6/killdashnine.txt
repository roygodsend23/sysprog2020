1#I guess I'll have to shut you down for good this time,
1#Already tried a SIGQUIT, so now it's KILL DASH 9.
1#You gotta learn when it's time for your thread to yield;
1#It shoulda slept; instead you stepped and now your fate is sealed.
1#I'll take your process off the run queue without even asking
1#'Cause my flow is like reentrant and preemptive multitasking.
1#Your sad rhymes are spinnin' like you're in a deadlock,
1#You're like a synchronous sock that don't know when to block;
1#So I pull out my keyboard and I pull out my glock,
1#And I dismount your girl and I mount /proc
1#And I've got your fuckin pid and the bottom line
1#Is that you best not front or else it's KILL DASH NINE.

1#KILL DASH NINE,
2#No more CPU time.
1#I run KILL DASH NINE,
2#And your process is mine.
1#I run KILL DASH NINE,
2#'Cause it's MY time to shine
1#So don't step outta line or else it's
2#KILL DASH NINE!

2#See it ain't about the Benjamins or Pentiums or Athlons,
2#But you rappin' 50 meters while I'm spittin' in decathlons.
2#Your shit's old and busted, mine's the new hotness;
2#You're like CLR and I'm like CLRS.
2#You're running csh and my shell is bash,
2#You're the tertiary storage; I'm the L1 cache.
2#I'm a web crawling spider; you an Internet mosquito;
2#You thought the 7-layer model referred to a burrito.
2#You're a dialup connection; I'm a gigabit LAN.
2#I last a mythical man-month; you a one-minute man.
2#It's like I'm running Thunderbird and you're still stuck with Pine,
2#Which is why I think it's time for me to KILL DASH NINE.

2#Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE
1#No more CPU time.
2#'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,
1#And your process is mine.
2#I said KILL DASH NINE
1#'Cause it's my time to shine,
2#So don't step outta line or else it's
1#KILL DASH NINE!

1#My posse throws down like leaky bucket regulators;
1#I was coding shit in MIPS while you were playing Space Invaders.
1#With my finger on the trigger I run ./configure
1#Yo, this package is big, but MY package is bigger.
1#I roll my weed with Zig Zag while I zag-zig splay,
1#And I do a bounds check before I write to an array.
1#I'm a loc'd out baller writing KLOCS a day,
1#'Cause it's publish or perish, fool, what can I say?
1#I'm 26 now, will I live to see 28?
1#Some days I wonder if I'll survive to graduate.
1#But hey, that's just fine, I won't ever resign,
1#And if fools try to step then it's KILL DASH NINE!

1#Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE,
2#From my command line
1#It's KILL DASH NINE
2#Sending chills down your spine,
1#I said KILL DASH NINE,
2#'Cause it's my time to shine,
1#So don't step outta line or else it's
2#KILL DASH NINE!

2#fs sa rlidwka
2#I'll chown your home and take your access away
2#Comin' straight outta Stanford, ain't nobody tougher,
2#Control-X, Control-C, I'll discard your fuckin' buffer.
2#You're outside your scope, son, close them curly brackets,
2#'Cause I drop punk-ass bitches like a modem drops packets.
2#Dump your motherfucking core, and trace your stack
2#'Cause where your ass is going, there won't be no callback.
2#See my style is divine and my code is sublime,
2#My career's in a climb and yours is in a decline.
2#I'll write a pound-define and assign you as mine,
2#So refine those sad rhymes or remove your plus signs,

2#Or it's KILL DASH NINE,
1#No more CPU time,
2#'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,
1#And your process is mine,
2#I said KILL DASH NINE
1#'Cause it's my time to shine,
2#Bitch you stepped outta line and now it's 
1#KILL DASH NINE!
